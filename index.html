            <h2>What are albums?</h2>
            <p>Music albums have been a staple in the music industry ever since its conception in 1948.</p> 
            <p>Essentially, an Album is a collection of audio recordings issued on a
            CD, vinyl, audio tape, or other mediums such as digital distribution.</p>
           
            <p>From the 60's till now, we have been living in what is called the "album
            era", where the sales of albums has been the dominant form of recorded music
            consumption and expression.</p>


            <h2>What constitutes an album?</h2>
            <p>Different areas in the world classify an artist's project differently. In the US, an album
                must have a minimum of 15 minutes playing time with at least 5 distinct tracks or a minimum of 30 minutes
                with no minimum track requirement. In the UK however, the requirement is if it has a minimum of 4 tracks or lasts
                more than 25 minutes.</p>
            <p>That being said, there are no formal rules against an artist self-proclaiming their work to be an album even if they
                don't meet the criteria.</p>


            <h2>Audio Formats</h2>
            <p>There are different ways that albums have been distributed throughout
                the years, whether it be digitally or physically. Examples are
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record" target="_blank">vinyls</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-track_tape" target="_blank">8-track tapes</a>, 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette" target="_blank">compact casettes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_download" target="_blank">
                MP3 albums</a>. </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The word goes way back, all the way to the times of ancient Rome. It described a board chalked or painted white, 
                on which decrees, edicts, and other public notices were inscribed in black. Then, the word came to denote a book of blank
                 pages in which verses, autographs, sketches, photographs and the like are collected, which finally led to the meaning as a
                 collection of audio recordings made into a single item.</p>
