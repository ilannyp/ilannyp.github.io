                In Primary School, I was in the school's Choir CCA. We got a distinction for SYF in 2015. I completed PSLE with a score of 214
                but was quite clueless as to what school I would want to go to. For better or for worse, I was recommended Montfort Secondary by
                my cousin.

            <p>In Secondary School, I went to another Performing Arts CCA, that being Drama Club. Never once did I act however, for I preferred,
            to be a backstage crew member. One of the things I had to do was handle props alongside a good friend of mine, Ethan. We made and
            decorated so many things for sets and acts. Secondary School wasn't all good times however. It was during this time of my life where
            I fell sick. The attendance I had for every term in my Secondary School life was either 2/3 or 1/2 of the total school days. Kinda
            had to work extra hard, and I'm lucky to have survived that whole ordeal thanks to the unrelenting support from my teachers and friends.
            In the end, I managed to score 16 for my L1R4 and met the requirements for my EAE acceptance.

            <p>Coming into this school was no easy feat. After working my butt off in Secondary School, I arrive into my desired course. The goal I had 
            since Sec 3. My academic experience here does make me want to pull my hair out sometimes, but I knew what I was getting into. Plus, I've
            met some new people I consider dear to me so its not bad. Finally having the freedom to choose whether or not to have a CCA does seem
            to be one of my favourite things about this though. Can't say I'm a fan of spending more time than I need in school.
