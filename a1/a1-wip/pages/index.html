            <p>Hi! Welcome to my website. My name is Ilan Firman Rahadian Mohd Syahrir Kartayasa Putra. I come from a family of 7,
            my parents, 2 brothers and 2 sisters. My aspiration is to be a video game developer in the future, having my own indie 
            game studio and a hit game. Of course, being introduced to video games at 3 years old and being <b>damn near addicted</b> to it 
            has greatly influenced me into pursuing this career.</p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>

            <p>Since I was raised in a family of 7, there were rarely any dull moments in my childhood with my siblings keeping me company.
            We were never in a right spot financially however, but I did have some entertainment at home. We owned a computer and an Xbox. The computer
            was my father's, and he'd download all sorts of games on it. I remember playing games like Counter-Strike and Command & Conquer.
            The Xbox too was his idea of "giving the kids something to do while mom and dad are gone" and it served its purpose very well. Plus, I got to play
            with my siblings more so that was fun. Halo, Tony Hawk, Wolfenstein. In retrospect maybe it wasn't a good idea to let kids well-under the age of 16
            playing some of these <i>but hey</i>, we seem to have turned out fine.

    <h3>Aspiration</h3>
    <div class = flexcontainer>
        <div class = content>
            <p>As I stated earlier, I aspire to become a game developer in the future. Seeing games like Hollow Knight and Mass Effect 2 inspired
            me to strive to be someone directly involved in making works of art such as them. I will continue to work and study to make this
            dream of mine come true.
            </p>

            <p>Here's a picture of me and 2 of my friends from NYP. There's more in the group but finding a photo of all of us in one picture taken in the past year is like 
                trying to hunt a unicorn. They've been good to me, we help one another in our work and play together too so yeah I do appreciate them.
