        <h2>The Types Of Albums</h2>
        <p>Of course, albums come in many shapes and forms. There are 3 types of albums that are
            prevalent in the music industry that I would like to share with you.
        </p> 
        <p>Although these are all albums, they're quite different from
            one another, and I'm not talking only in their genre. They're also very much different in the purpose of their creation.</p>

        <h2>Compilation Albums</h2>
        <p>Let's start off with compilation albums. As in the name implies, 
            compilation albums are quite literally a compilation of the musician's 
            songs from various recording projects. They mostly don't follow any 
            "grand" themes, with its often only theme and purpose being the artist's "greatest hits".
            Songs included on a compilation album may be previously released or unreleased tracks, usually
            from various recording sessions by one or several performers.</p>
            <p>Example: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2ANVost0y2y52ema1E9xAZ?si=BuGMN41jTWOm9Rnas8mU5A" target="_blank">Thriller</a> by Michael Jackson</p>
          </div>
          <div class ="category">
        <h2>Concept Albums</h2> 
        <p>Concept albums is an interesting one. Its described as an album that holds meaning or larger purpose when the tracks are
            put together collectively than individually. This is usually achieved through establishing a single narrative or a theme,
            which can be lyrical, compositional or instrumental. Though the term is more associated with rock music, other genres have
            managed to pick it up as a result of its popularity and use of expression.</p>
            <p>Example: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5zi7WsKlIiUXv09tbGLKsE?si=D4xC_F6rR8G5mDtR5hjQxw" target="_blank">IGOR</a> by Tyler, The Creator</p>

        <h2>Experimental Albums</h2> 
        <p>Experimental albums, or experimental music, is a label for any music or music genre that pushes pre-defined boundaries or genre
            definitions. The broad definition of "experimental" is an opposition to, and questioning of institutionalized musical compositional, performing, and aesthetic traditions.</p> 
            <p>Example: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6GjwtEZcfenmOf6l18N7T7?si=XVY1YxQPSYm4LiQqORWJ6Q" target="_blank">Kid A</a> by Radiohead</p>
